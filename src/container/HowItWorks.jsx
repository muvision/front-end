      <p>
        We use OpenCV to split the image into lines of math expressions and feed the individual characters into our own weighted average ensemble neural network which classifies the individual characters. ðŸ¤– <br />
        Our weighted average model is built out of a custom Tensorflow and Keras model, and pretrained models including Resnet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNet. ðŸ”¬ <br />
        Finally, we use the PyLatex library to convert the text into Latex code. ðŸ’» <br />
        We hope you enjoy using MuVision! ðŸ˜Š
